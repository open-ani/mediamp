 * The current playback state of the player.

 * ```kotlin
 * fun PlaybackState.isPlaybackRunning() = this >= PlaybackState.PAUSED

 *
 * See documentation of [MediampPlayer] to get te flowchart of state transformation and understand how state changes.
 * Also see each state in [PlaybackState] for more details.
