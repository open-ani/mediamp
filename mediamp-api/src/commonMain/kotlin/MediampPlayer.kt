/**
 * An extensible media player that plays [MediaData]s. Instances can be obtained from a [MediampPlayerFactory].
 *
 * The [MediampPlayer] interface itself defines only the minimal API for controlling the player, including:
 * - Playback State: [playbackState], [mediaData], [mediaProperties], [currentPositionMillis], [playbackProgress]
 * - Playback Control: [pause], [resume], [stopPlayback], [seekTo], [skip]
 *
 * Depending on whether the underlying player implementation supports a feature, [features] can be used to access them.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 * 
 * MediampPlayer uses [PlaybackState] to represent the current state of the player.
 * 
 * MediampPlayer implementations (with VLC or MPV, or any others) are required to respect to the following state transition mechanism.
 * 
 * > Hint: You may toggle off doc rendering in IDE if diagram glitches

 * 
 * ```
 * Calling the method labelled to the right of the diagram, at any state included in the path, 
 * will transform the state to the destination state pointed by arrow.
 * 
 * For example, calling [stopPlayback] when `state >= READY`(incl [READY][PlaybackState.READY], [PAUSED][PlaybackState.PAUSED], 
 * [PLAYING][PlaybackState.PLAYING], [BUFFERING][PlaybackState.PAUSED_BUFFERING]) will always transform state to `FINISHED`.
 * 
 * ### Invalid calls are ignored
 *
 * Calls to any method while not at its state transformation path will be ignored.
 * 
 * For example, calling [stopPlayback] at state [FINISHED][PlaybackState.FINISHED], [CREATED][PlaybackState.CREATED], 
 * [ERROR][PlaybackState.ERROR] and [DESTROYED][PlaybackState.DESTROYED] will be ignored and take no effect.
 *
 * ### State transform directly to target state
 * 
 * Although each method has its transformation path, calling will not produce intermediate state.
 * 
 * For example, call [close] at [PLAYING][PlaybackState.PLAYING] will directly transform state to [DESTROYED][PlaybackState.DESTROYED].
 * Any state of `state >= ERROR && state <= PAUSED` will be emitted.
 * 
 * ### [setMediaData] is special
 *
 * `setMediaData` has special transformation path. It will always transform state into [READY][PlaybackState.READY] and may have intermediate state transformation.
 * Because user can set new media data at any state or any time except [DESTROYED][PlaybackState.DESTROYED] state, including [READY][PlaybackState.READY] state itself.
 * 
 * See [setMediaData] for more details.
 *
 * ### Error can occurred at any time
 * 
 * When *fatal error* occurred, state will always be transformed to [ERROR][PlaybackState.ERROR] directly.
 *
 * Error state has high priority. If an error occurred at background while calling a method, final state should be [ERROR][PlaybackState.ERROR].
 * 
 * ## Additional Features
 *
 * - [org.openani.mediamp.features.AudioLevelController]: Controls the audio volume and mute state.
 * - [org.openani.mediamp.features.Buffering]: Monitors the buffering progress.
 * - [org.openani.mediamp.features.PlaybackSpeed]: Controls the playback speed.
 * - [org.openani.mediamp.features.Screenshots]: Captures screenshots of the video.
 *
 * To obtain a feature, use the [PlayerFeatures.get] on [features].
 *
 * ## Threading Model
 *
 * This interface is not thread-safe. Concurrent calls to [resume] will lead to undefined behavior.
 * However, flows might be collected from multiple threads simultaneously while performing another call like [resume] on a single thread.
 *
 * Playback control methods are expected to be called from the UI thread. Calls from illegal threads will cause an exception.
 * Asynchronous operations of actual player implementations should ensure that playback state must be transformed to target state.
 *
 * On other platforms, calls are not required to be on the UI thread but should still be called from a single thread.
 * The implementation is guaranteed to be non-blocking and fast so, it is a recommended approach of making all calls from the UI thread in common code.
 *
 * ## Not safe for inheritance
 *
 * [MediampPlayer] interface is not safe for inheritance from third-party users, as new abstract methods might be added in the future.

     * This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread, including the UI thread.
     *
     * Setting the same [MediaData] will be ignored.
     *
     * ### State transition
     * 
     * If [data] is not equal to the currently playing media data, the later will be closed before [data] is set. 
     * That is equivalent to (atomically) calling [stopPlayback] before calling this method, in which case [playbackState] may emit a [FINISHED]. 
     *
     * **State transition may be asynchronous and cancellable.**
     * Depending on whether the player implements synchronous opening or asynchronous opening, 
     * this method returns normally, [playbackState] either has already emitted [READY][PlaybackState.READY] or will emit it in the near future. 
     * In other words:
     * 
     * - If the player implements synchronous media opening (e.g. [DummyMediampPlayer]), observers of [playbackState] will have already seen an [READY][PlaybackState.READY] state before this method returns. 
     * Or, this method may throw an exception to indicate an error, and transit state to [ERROR][PlaybackState.ERROR].
     * 
     * - If the player implements asynchronous media opening (e.g. ExoPlayer), observers of [playbackState] MAY NOT have already seen an [READY][PlaybackState.READY] state before this method returns. 
     * Instead, the observers may collect an [READY][PlaybackState.READY] in arbitrary time after this method returns.
     * Decoding errors can only be seen by the observers, not the caller of [setMediaData]. 
     * If before the [READY][PlaybackState.READY] is emit (i.e. before initial video decoding is completed), [setMediaData] is called again, a new asynchronous opening process will start, cancelling the old one. 
     * So observers will not see an [READY][PlaybackState.READY] for the old media, but only the one for the new [data].
     * 
     * ### Error handling
     * 
     * This method will open media data by calling [MediaData.open], if and only if the [data] instance is different from the currently playing media data.
     * 
     * If an exception is occurred while opening, the playback state will transform to [ERROR][PlaybackState.ERROR], 
     * while the exception will also be propagated to the caller.
     * 
     * Note that only exceptions during [opening][MediaData.open] are propagated. 
     * Exceptions happened in the player implementation, for example, asynchronous video decoding, etc., will NOT be thrown from this method. 
     * These errors can be seen by observing the [playbackState] flow.
