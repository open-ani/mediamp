/**
 * An extensible media player that plays [MediaData]s. Instances can be obtained from a [MediampPlayerFactory].
 *
 * The [MediampPlayer] interface itself defines only the minimal API for controlling the player, including:
 * - Playback State: [playbackState], [mediaData], [mediaProperties], [currentPositionMillis], [playbackProgress]
 * - Playback Control: [pause], [resume], [stopPlayback], [seekTo], [skip]
 *
 * Depending on whether the underlying player implementation supports a feature, [features] can be used to access them.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 * 
 * MediampPlayer uses [PlaybackState] to represent the current state of the player.
 * 
 * MediampPlayer implementations (with VLC or MPV, or any others) are required to respect to the following state transition mechanism.
 * 
 * > Hint: You may toggle off doc rendering in IDE if diagram glitches

 * 
 * ```
 * Calling the function labelled to the right of the diagram, at any state included in the path, 
 * will transform the state to the destination state pointed by arrow.
 * 
 * For example, calling [stopPlayback] when `state >= READY`(incl [READY][PlaybackState.READY], [PAUSED][PlaybackState.PAUSED], 
 * [PLAYING][PlaybackState.PLAYING], [BUFFERING][PlaybackState.PAUSED_BUFFERING]) will always transform state to `FINISHED`.
 *
 * ### Invalid calls are ignored
 *
 * Calls to any method while not at its state transformation path will be ignored.
 * 
 * For example, calling [stopPlayback] at state [FINISHED][PlaybackState.FINISHED], [CREATED][PlaybackState.CREATED], 
 * [ERROR][PlaybackState.ERROR] and [DESTROYED][PlaybackState.DESTROYED] will be ignored and take no effect.
 *
 * ### State transform directly to target state
 * 
 * Although each method has its transformation path, calling will not produce intermediate state.
 * 
 * For example, call [close] at [PLAYING][PlaybackState.PLAYING] will directly transform state to [DESTROYED][PlaybackState.DESTROYED].
 * Any state of `state >= ERROR && state <= PAUSED` will be emitted.
 *
 * ### [setMediaData] is special
 *
 * [setMediaData] has special transformation path. It will always transform state into [READY][PlaybackState.READY].
 * Because user can set new media data at any state or any time except [DESTROYED][PlaybackState.DESTROYED],
 * including [READY][PlaybackState.READY] itself.
 * 
 * ### Error can occurred at any time
 * 
 * When *fatal error* occurred, state will always be transformed to [ERROR][PlaybackState.ERROR] directly.
 *
 * Error state has high priority. If an error occurred at background while calling a method, final state should be [ERROR][PlaybackState.ERROR].
 * 
 * ## Additional Features
 *
 * - [org.openani.mediamp.features.AudioLevelController]: Controls the audio volume and mute state.
 * - [org.openani.mediamp.features.Buffering]: Monitors the buffering progress.
 * - [org.openani.mediamp.features.PlaybackSpeed]: Controls the playback speed.
 * - [org.openani.mediamp.features.Screenshots]: Captures screenshots of the video.
 *
 * To obtain a feature, use the [PlayerFeatures.get] on [features].
 *
 * ## Threading Model
 *
 * This interface is not thread-safe. Concurrent calls to [resume] will lead to undefined behavior.
 * However, flows might be collected from multiple threads simultaneously while performing another call like [resume] on a single thread.
 *
 * All methods in this interface are expected to be called from the **UI thread** on Android.
 * Calls from illegal threads will cause an exception.
 *
 * On other platforms, calls are not required to be on the UI thread but should still be called from a single thread.
 * The implementation is guaranteed to be non-blocking and fast so, it is a recommended approach of making all calls from the UI thread in common code.
 *
 * ## Not safe for inheritance
 *
 * [MediampPlayer] interface is not safe for inheritance from third-party users, as new abstract methods might be added in the future.
